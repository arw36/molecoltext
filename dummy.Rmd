## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("MEImages/IMG_1549.jpeg")
```
