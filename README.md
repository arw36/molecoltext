Molecular Ecology - interactive textbook

I'm not very good at coding or maintaining GitHub, so apologies for anybody peeking in. 

As my advanced undergrad/early grad course in molecular ecology flipped online in spring 2020,
 I used our working experience in R to post new info and assignments with R Markdown so they
 could learn in a flexible way using available data and Shiny simulations (written by Silas Tittes and others).
 
 At this point I am working on improving it while I teach with it, and running into problems
 making images, links, paths to code etc. work across operating systems, and easily for
 students with no programming or bioinformatic experience to best of my abilities!
 
I would hope - but know it isn't yet true - that the file Jan2022_MolEcol.Rmd will run on your
machine, using images in "MEImages" and referring to the shiny apps in "shiny_popgen-master".
Thus the paths are important! However please contact me if you need help making it work for your
system, or if you have ideas on how to make it more readily portable to students.
