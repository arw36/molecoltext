# molecoltext
molecular ecology text, started march 2020. note it is *not done* as of march 2021 but putting files here to renew my github skills!

this text is being developed for the cross-listed ECOL/GENE 4530/6530 at university of georgia to improve the experiential nature of learning the methods necessary for the field of 'molecular ecology'. maintaining it as an .Rmd allows direct analytical opportunities and the ability to incorporate some simple simulation tools using Shiny.

Currently the Shiny simulators are not mine: to use this text you will need to download:

1. https://github.com/silastittes/shiny_popgen this github archive has a number of super useful shiny apps that are required; as written, the .Rmd will look for this directory to be in the same directory.
2. Im working to make the R code look for the libraries it needs but obviously all this code may need some libraries and dependencies. 
3. Please recognize that coding is not my first love or top skill!
