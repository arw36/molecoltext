# molecoltext
molecular ecology text, started march 2020. note it is *not done* as of may 2021 but putting files here to renew my github skills!

this text is being developed for the cross-listed ECOL/GENE 4530/6530 at university of georgia to improve the experiential nature of learning the methods necessary for the field of 'molecular ecology'. maintaining it as an .Rmd allows direct analytical opportunities and the ability to incorporate some simple simulation tools using Shiny.

Currently the Shiny simulators are not mine; I have included https://github.com/silastittes/shiny_popgen in this archive from Silas Tittes who wrote the Shiny apps. If you download the Zip of this repository it should maintain the file structure within that directory so that all will work, just open the main .Rmd file in RStudio.

Please recognize that coding is not my first love or top skill :)
