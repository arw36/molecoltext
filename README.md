molecular ecology - interactive textbook

well thats odd... I did have a README and my half-baked approach to GitHub lost it somehow... anyway as my Molecular Ecology course flipped to online in spring 2020, I used .Rmd to my advantage to teach them in a flexible way using Shiny and building in code to evaluate data. I'm hoping this will be fully ready by January 2022!
